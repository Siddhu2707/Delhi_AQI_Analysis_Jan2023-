# Delhi_AQI_Analysis_Jan2023
## Introduction
Welcome to our repository on the analysis and visualization of Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI). Air quality has become a critical concern for urban environments, especially in densely populated cities like Delhi. This presentation aims to explore the trends, patterns, and implications of AQI data in Delhi, providing insights through comprehensive data analysis and visualizations.[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepaksirohiwal/delhi-air-quality)
## Steps involved
1) Gather air quality data from various sources, such as government monitoring stations, sensors, or satellite imagery.  
2) Calculate the aqi using standardized formulas and guidelines provided by environmental agencies.  
3) Create visualizations, such as line charts or heatmaps, to represent the AQI over time or across geographical regions.  
4) Compare the AQI metrics with the recommended air quality metrics.
 ## Key Performance indicator(KPI)
1) Time Series Analysis of Air Pollutants in Delhi  
2) AQI of Delhi in January month  
3) AQI Category Distribution Over Time  
4) Pollutant Concentrations in Delhi  
5) Correlation Between Pollutants  
6) Hourly Average AQI Trends in Delhi (Jan 2023)  
7) Average AQI by Day of the Week
## Summary
Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis is crucial for understanding and managing environmental quality, particularly in highly polluted areas like Delhi. Key contributors to Delhi's poor AQI include vehicular emissions, which release pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter; industrial emissions from factories; dust from construction activities; agricultural burning in surrounding regions; and waste burning practices. Each of these factors adds significantly to the overall air pollution, impacting public health and environmental quality. Monitoring and analyzing AQI helps in assessing these contributions and formulating effective strategies for improvement.
